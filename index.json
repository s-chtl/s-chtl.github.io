However, the correctness of the computation result is not ensured. We propose two error detection encodings and build authenticators that enable practical client-verification of cloud-based homomorphic computations under different trade-offs and without compromising on the features of the encryption algorithm. Our authenticators operate on top of trending ring learning with errors based fully homomorphic encryption schemes over the integers. We implement our solution in VERITAS, a ready-to-use system for verification of outsourced computations executed over encrypted data. We show that contrary to prior work VERITAS supports verification of any homomorphic operation and we demonstrate its practicality for various applications, such as ride-hailing, genomic-data analysis, encrypted search, and machine-learning training and inference.\nThe latest version of this paper can be found on ArXiv.\n","date":1658966400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658966400,"objectID":"2a3074f6ca3585968a76a23b15d490b0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/veritas/","publishdate":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/veritas/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Verifiable Encodings for Secure Homomorphic Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Homomorphic encryption schemes enable computations to be executed directly on ciphertexts without knowledge of the secret key, hence they are becoming an auspicious solution to protecting confidentiality in cloud computing.

This system, referred to as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact’s identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user’s phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server. Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user’s phone. Other users’ apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the device’s owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app detects a high risk, it will inform the user.\nThe latest version of this work is available on ArXiv.\n","date":1590364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590364800,"objectID":"5a47dfa8ebd1e862f8f9820f2fabb491","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/dp3t/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dp3t/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Chatel*","Arnout Devos*","Matthias Grossglauser","*Equal contribution","",""],"categories":null,"content":"In this paper, we present a reproduction of the paper of Bertinetto et al.[2019] ‘Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers’ as part of the ICLR 2019 Reproducibility Challenge.
