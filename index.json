Digitalization has the potential to increase the efficiency and fairness of aid-distribution systems, and recent work by Wang et al. has shown that these benefits are possible without creating privacy harms for aid recipients. However, their work only provides a solution for one particular aid-distribution scenario in which aid recipients receive a pre-defined set of goods. Yet, in many situations it is desirable to enable recipients to decide which items they need at each moment to satisfy their specific needs. We formalize these needs into functional, deployment, security, and privacy requirements, and design a privacy-preserving digital wallet for aid distribution. Our smart-card-based solution enables aid recipients to spend a pre-defined budget at different vendors to obtain the items that they need. We prove our solution’s security and privacy properties, and show it is practical at scale.\nThe latest version of this paper can be found on ArXiv.\n","date":1738368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738368000,"objectID":"ba8b9e84e176e11aec232309132276fd","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/wallet/","publishdate":"2025-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wallet/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"A Low-Cost Privacy-Preserving Digital Wallet for Humanitarian Aid Distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the digital era, users share their personal data with service providers to obtain some utility, e.g., access to high-quality services.

Our authenticators operate on top of trending ring learning with errors based fully homomorphic encryption schemes over the integers.

This system, referred to as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact’s identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user’s phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server. Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user’s phone. Other users’ apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the device’s owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app detects a high risk, it will inform the user.\nThe latest version of this work is available on ArXiv.\n","date":1590364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590364800,"objectID":"5a47dfa8ebd1e862f8f9820f2fabb491","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/dp3t/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dp3t/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Chatel*","Arnout Devos*","Matthias Grossglauser","*Equal contribution","",""],"categories":null,"content":"In this paper, we present a reproduction of the paper of Bertinetto et al.[2019] ‘Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers’ as part of the ICLR 2019 Reproducibility Challenge.
