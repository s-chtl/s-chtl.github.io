abstract = {Homomorphic encryption has become a practical solution for protecting the privacy of computations on sensitive data. However, existing homomorphic encryption pipelines do not guarantee the correctness of the computation result in the presence of a malicious adversary. We propose two plaintext encodings compatible with state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption schemes that enable practical client-verification of homomorphic computations while supporting all the operations required for modern privacy-preserving analytics. Based on these encodings, we introduce VERITAS, a ready-to-use library for the verification of computations executed over encrypted data. VERITAS is the first library that supports the verification of any homomorphic operation. We demonstrate its practicality for various applications and, in particular, we show that it enables verifiability of homomorphic analytics with less than $3\times$ computation overhead compared to the homomorphic encryption baseline.},
